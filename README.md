<h2 align="center" style="border-bottom: none">Challenge Bravo</h2>

The implementation of the current weather display and the forecast (both hourly and daily) for any searched city was resolved using the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API and the [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) framework for [Elixir Language](https://elixir-lang.org/). A **user interface** was developed to simplify interaction and provide a clear, accessible view of the weather data.

## üí° Solution

With the help of the base template generated when creating a new Phoenix project, a simple page was built in the classic way. Using various HTML elements and some JavaScript, an interface was created capable of retrieving local data through a model backed by an SQLite3 database, which is used for data persistence and storing favorite cities. Controllers serve as the bridge to call the application‚Äôs logic, while the views can be rendered and presented in a user-friendly way to the end user.

### Simple UI

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/CarlitosObr/prueba-tecnica-bravo/blob/main/images/search_page.png" alt="Search" width=100%>
    <div align="center">
        <br><br>
        <div>A search bar is added to look up cities and display a list of matches, with each match having the option to be marked as a favorite.</div><br>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    </td>
    <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/CarlitosObr/prueba-tecnica-bravo/blob/main/images/favorites_page.png" alt="Favorite city" width=100%>
    <div align="center">
        <br><br>
        <div>Display the list with the cities marked as favorites, in order to view their weather.</div><br>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/CarlitosObr/prueba-tecnica-bravo/blob/main/images/weather_first.png" alt="Current weather">
    <div align="center">
        <br><br>
        <div>Card showing the current weather, the maximum, the minimum, and what the weather will be like 24 hours after the current time.</div><br>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="https://github.com/CarlitosObr/prueba-tecnica-bravo/blob/main/images/weather_second.png" alt="Left days">
    <div align="center">
        <br><br>
        <div>Different cards that show what the weather will be like on the remaining days of the week.</div><br>
        <br><br>
    </div>
    </td>
  </tr>

## üì¶ Architecture explanation

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" align="center" >
      <img src="https://github.com/CarlitosObr/prueba-tecnica-bravo/blob/main/images/MVC.png" alt="MVC" width=60%>
    <div align="justify">
        <br><br>
        <div>A simple architecture such as MVC was used, which is easy to understand and manage, and fits well with the way the Phoenix framework is designed. With the help of controllers that receive user requests‚Äîwhether from a UI or an API‚Äîcalls are made to the models. In this case, a model was created to store favorite cities. The process was straightforward, as database migrations are defined through commands executed within the framework. Using various methods, the required queries can be performed, whether an insert, delete, update, or simply retrieving the necessary data so that the controller can return, through the view, the information initially requested by the user. This is the way the architecture works, and it was the approach used to resolve this problem.</div><br>

## üó£Ô∏è Trade-offs

Due to attempting a quick implementation, some tasks were delegated that should ideally be handled on the server side rather than in the browser. Handling certain calls to third-party APIs in the client may expose keys that should remain private, which affects the security of the application. Application logic should reside entirely within the controllers, not the views, although some logic was placed in the views in this case.

Additionally, exposing data is a poor practice. It is important to use more robust databases with proper authentication to prevent easy access to sensitive data. For practical purposes, an SQLite database was used, which may not be suitable for production environments.

## üó£Ô∏è Possible improvements
The application could be dockerized, using Docker Compose to run one container for a more robust database, such as PostgreSQL, and another container for the Phoenix application. This setup would allow for more reliable and realistic testing.

Additionally, using more LiveView could accelerate development and allow for easier-to-implement templates. Leveraging LiveView would also improve the UI with more dynamic views and interactive elements, enhancing the overall user experience. However, this approach may present challenges under high user concurrency since processing occurs server-side, and in some cases, client-side handling might be preferable to reduce latency and ensure appropriate response times.

Implementing some form of caching could also improve the efficiency of displaying favorite cities, avoiding repeated database requests each time that view is accessed.

Handle exceptions more effectively, since there can always be a gap where an error might occur. This is where another exception could be used to ensure that the functionality of the code does not break and can continue working normally, always providing some type of alert or message to the user.

Finally, the project structure could be improved by better organizing directories and placing each piece of logic in its proper location, making the application easier to understand and maintain.
